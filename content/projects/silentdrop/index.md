Silent drop is a personal project of social platform. It is currently in active development but the first MVP includes a Blog and a "Pin wall" feature to share video, images, quotes and texts. The server is a Google App Engine Flexible Environment and uses the Google Datastore as database.

Technically this project allows me to learn a lot about Cloud Services, NoSQL databse (Google Datastore), node.js + Express, REST API design and Continuous Integration with Jenkins.

The project has two main parts: the platform itself and Content Management System, both written in Angular 4+
