Silent drop is a personal project that I created to share content about environment, personal growth and the sharing economy. It is still in development but the first version includes a "Blog", a "Pin wall" (to share video, images, quotes and texts) and a "Movies" section to share long duration videos.

The project has two main parts:

* The platform itself written in **Angular** (2+)
* A CMS written in **React**

As a solo developer on this side project I worked on the following tasks:

* Design and UX
* Front-end development (Angular + React for CMS)
* Back-end development (Node.js + Express)
* API design (Google Datastore)
* CI integration (Jenkins)
