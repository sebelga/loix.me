Silent drop is a personal project that I created to share content about environment, personal growth and the sharing economy. It is still in development but the first version includes a "Blog", a "Pin wall" (to share video, images, quotes and texts) and a "Movies" section to share long duration videos.

The project has two main parts:  

* The platform itself written in Angular
* A Content Management System written in React.  

Technically this project allows me to learn about Cloud Services, NoSQL database, backend programming, REST API and data layer design and Continuous Integration.
