gstore-node is a 'mongoose' clone for the Google Datastore. With it we can create Schemas to model the entities to be saved in the Datastore.

The entities are then automatically validates (their properties kind and value) before being saved.

Custom methods, virtual properties and "hooks" (middleware) can also be added on the Schemas.
