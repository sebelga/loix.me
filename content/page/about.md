A senior software engineer passionate about user experience with a meticulous attention to detail, striving to create **unique interactive experiences** across the different screens. Excellent problem solver and great communicator.

Over 18 years **developing complex applications** in high-pressure environments with experience in dealing directly with new and existing clients. I help businesses succeed in building modern applications, making sure their software is optimized, well-tested, maintainable and scalable.

Although my expertise lies in the **front-end** development, I also work on the **back-end** with Node.js. Some of the languages/technologies I use are: Javascript, React, Node.js, Typescript, Angular, rxjs, Redux, Webpack, Rollup... 
I am currently learning [GraphQL](http://graphql.org/), [Go](https://golang.org/) and [Serverless architecture](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/) (AWS Lambda + API Gateway)

Youâ€™ll probably catch me more than once designing and building REST APIs or building scripts for Continuous Integration :)

I am the maintainer of a few **open source projects**, the main one being a [_Mongoose_ clone](https://github.com/sebelga/gstore-node) for the Google Datastore.

#### Current position

Since January 2017 I am working at the European Commission as a senior front-end engineer & architect.
