A senior fron-tend engineer passionate about user experience with a meticulous attention to detail, striving to create **unique interactive experiences** across the different screens. Excellent problem solver and great communicator.

Over 18 years **developing complex applications** in high-pressure environments with experience in dealing directly with new and existing clients. I help businesses succeed in building modern Web Applications by making sure their software is optimized, well-tested, maintainable and scalable.

I also develop on the **back-end** with Node.js, storing the data in different databases (Google Datastore/PostgreSQL/Redis). You'll probably catch me more than once designing and building REST APIs or creating scripts for continuous integration and deployment. :)

I am **currently learning** [GraphQL](http://graphql.org/) and [Go](https://golang.org/) (to get some _strongly typed_ language under my belt!).

I am the maintainer of a few **open source projects**, the main one being a [_Mongoose_ clone](https://github.com/sebelga/gstore-node) for the Google Datastore.

#### Current position

Since January 2017 I am working at the European Commission as a senior front-end engineer/architect.
