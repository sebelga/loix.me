I am a full-stack engineer and creative problem solver who strives to create **unique interactive experiences** through great software.

I have experience **developing complex applications** in high-pressure environments. I help businesses succeed in building robust applications, making sure their software is optimized, well-tested, maintainable and scalable.

My expertise lies both in front-end development and back-end with Node.js (+ currently learning Go).  
Some of the languages/technologies I use are Javascript/Typescript, React, Node.js, GraphQL, Angular, rxjs, Redux, DynamoDB, AWS Lambda...

I have an **entrepreneurial mindset** and I am the maintainer of a few **open source projects**, the main one being a [_Mongoose_ clone](https://github.com/sebelga/gstore-node) for the Google Datastore (gstore-node).

#### Current position

Since October 2018 I am working for [Elastic](https://www.elastic.co) as a principal software engineer.
