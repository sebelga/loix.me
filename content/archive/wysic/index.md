wysic was an entrepreneurial project I worked on between January 2014 and July 2016. Its aim was to offer music fans a live streaming concerts platform to follow their band on tour anywhere in the world. Unfortunately, the project never took off... mainly because of the difficulties to obtain the rights and licenses necessary, and to find a solid business model around them.

Both the platform itself and the administration panel were written in AngularJS. I designed the REST API to connect to the MySQL database hosted on Google SQL. I used the very good python framework web2py for the backend running in Google App Engine.

Apart from offering live streaming live broadcasts, the platform had also a fully working shop online with payments processed through Stripe, chatrooms with PubNub, video-chats with WebRTC and real-time push messages.
