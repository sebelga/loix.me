Design and programming of an iPad application. This app replaced the traditional paper listing at the door of an event to easily manage the access of the guests.

The day before the event a CVS was uploaded to the database through a small admin panel. Guests could also added, edited or deleted manually in this admin page.

The guests could access the event through several gates (an thus multiple iPad), so in order for the organizers to know at all times how many invitees were yet to arrive, the application was synced on a dedicated server.

New guests could also be manually created at the door. At the end of the day a CVS report (of atendance) was sent by email to the client.
