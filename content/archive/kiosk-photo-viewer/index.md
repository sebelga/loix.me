This kiosk application let the user view all the photos taken at an event. It then could chose which photo he'd like to take home on an USB drive.

The photograph uploaded his photos on a computer with a touch screen, and the guests could bring home a copy of any picture they wanted.

The application included also a screen-saver constantly updated with the latest photos of the day.

I worked both on the design + UX of the application and the ActionScript 3 programming.
